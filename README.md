## NodeStack

ðŸš§ Warning: this is just for fun, not to take it seriously at all. 

Just some playing with pure node and typescript (avoiding frameworks)

> Current features: 

### Context 
CRUD data into memory

### Router 
 A very simplifyed version of express.js
 - By default it writes data into memory through context
 - It could write the context entries into file
 - It could open the written file and return it's content
